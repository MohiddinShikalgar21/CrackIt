# CrackIt
An Online MockTest Platform for MHT CET Aspirants.

CrackIt!: Online Mock Test System,  can be adapted by the students in order to make 
their studies easier. The system is being divided into two parts: Client and Server that are 
designed to give the system maximum benefit by demonstrating the services of each 
individual part. The Proposed Project would allow the admin/server to add tests,edit 
them, add/delete study related resources etc. and allow user/client to attempt mock 
tests, view results/rank, access/download study resources etc. Thus the system would 
create an user-friendly atmosphere in its interface and could prove itself to be 
extremely useful among the Mht cet Aspirants.
